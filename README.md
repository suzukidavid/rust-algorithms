# Algorithm Cookbook in Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EbTech/rust-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EbTech/rust-algorithms)

A collection of classic data structures and algorithms, emphasizing beauty and clarity over full generality. As such, this should not be viewed as a blackbox *library*, but as a whitebox *cookbook* demonstrating the translation of abstract concepts into executable code. I hope it will be useful to students and educators, as well as competition programmers.

## For Students and Educators

When learning a new algorithm or data structure, it's often helpful to see or play with a concrete implementation. As such, this repository catalogues several classic algorithms in their simplest forms.

In addition, the Rust language has outstanding pedagogical attributes. Its compiler acts as a teacher, enforcing strict discipline while pointing to clearer ways to structure one's logic.

## For Competition Programmers

The original intent of this project was to build a reference for use in programming competitions such as [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com) and the [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam). As a result, it contains algorithms that are frequently useful to have in one's toolkit, with an emphasis on making the code concise and easy to modify under time pressure.

Most competitive programmers use C/C++ because it allows for fast coding as well as fast execution. However, these languages are notoriously unsafe, wasting a considerable share of the contestant's time and attention on accident prevention and debugging. Java is the next most popular choice, offering a bit of safety at some expense to coding and execution speed. To my delight, I found that Rust provides a lot more safety than Java without the visual clutter, and it's *fast*. A proficient Rust programmer stands to gain a competitive advantage as well as a more pleasant experience!

## Programming Language Advocacy

My other goal is to appeal to developers who feel, as I once did, trapped between the lesser of headaches (e.g., C++ and Java), to raise awareness that *it doesn't have to be this way*. Rather than trying to persuade you with words, this repository aims to show by example and ease the learning curve a bit. See [Jim Blandy's *Why Rust?*](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/why-rust.pdf) for a brief introduction, or just [dive in](https://www.rust-lang.org)!
